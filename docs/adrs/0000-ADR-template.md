## Status <!-- Status of this ADR -->
N/A

## Alternatives Considered <!-- Short list of considered alternatives, should include the chosen path -->
- Make an ADR template in the repo
- Send an email describing how to make an ADR to everyone
- Make an ADR template in Google Docs
- ...

## Decision Outcome <!-- Summary of the decision -->
Made a template within the `docs/ADRs` repo directory. It was based on the Truss (DU project) ADRs [^1]

## Consequences <!-- Summary of the decision -->
Adds a file to the repo, but allows easy discovery. Makes updating the template straightfoward if needed. However, this may need to be revisted if multiple repos are create for the project, as that might require duplicating the template, or changing where ADRs are stored.

## Pros and Cons of the Alternatives <!-- List Pros/Cons of each considered alternative -->

### Make an ADR template
- `+` Discoverable
- `-` Only exists in one repo, might be hard to use if more repos are created for the project.

### Send an email describing how to make an ADR to everyone
- `+` Everyone is notifed
- `-` Not discoverable after initial email
- `-` Hard to update easily, might lose track of who to email
- `-` Silly

### Send an email describing how to make an ADR to everyone
- `+` May work better if there are many repos related to the project
- `-` Not particulary discoverable
